## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__ It's okay, the community is definitely very active and helpful, but there will be some catching up need as pretty much the whole thing is written in typescript, and it's a big project, but I suppose if there are issues that are both beginner friendly and in a familiar language, then it can be worked on.




__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__ Yes



__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__ Yes




__Do pull requests get reviewed?__ Yes



__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__ Sometimes



__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__ Typescript



__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__ Not really
