## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__ It's very not friendly for beginners. The repositories are quite difficult to navigate through because it's hard to grasp the big picture. Also, the project is basically run by a small group of people who are overseeing everything so it is hard for beginners to contribute.




__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__ No, they used to years ago but not anymore in recent years



__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__ Yes




__Do pull requests get reviewed?__ Yes



__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__ Yes, but it's mostly run by the maintainers themselves.



__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__ No, but some knowledge in diabetes could be helpful.


__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__ Yes, knowledge in web development is required, specifically, redux, docker, etc.
