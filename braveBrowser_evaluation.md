## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__
Not very beginner friendly given the code is split into multiple repositories and there are no issues marked as easy or beginner. While the directions are clear as to how to start, it can be overwhelming to get involved with no familiarity.



__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__
The maintainers are pretty helpful and respond quickly to questions or concerns brought up in the issues. Some will include photos and version information to give more context.


__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__
While the maintainers keep a professional demeanor, some of the contributors are unfriendly or rude. This makes sense given there is no code of conduct present in the repository.



__Do pull requests get reviewed?__
Yes, they get reviewed and often quite quickly.


__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__
No, given there are so many commits we could not find maintainers thanking the contributors.


__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__
Knowledge of JavaScript and Chromium is needed for functional changes but anyone can make documentation or small bug fixes. Some issues may require C++ changes in Brave code or Chromium.


__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__
You need a GitHub account and Brave browser desktop access. They recommend installing a Standard plugin to ensure code style consistency and link to all recommended external applications.
