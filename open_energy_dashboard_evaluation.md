## Finding info about contributing on the website.

In the following section you should only enter the information that you
found on the project website. Some of the answers will be impossible to find, others
may be very hard to find. Do not _google_ for answers.

__Project website:__ [Open Energy Dashboard](https://openenergydashboard.github.io/).


__What is the purpose of the project:__ OED was founded under the belief that sharing and working together will advance the common goals. Instead of producing another energy dashboard targeting a single organization, it decided to make a dashboard that would be usable and valuable to a wide range of organizations. OED pursued this path because the existing dashboards were not portable, had limited functionality or were not free.
