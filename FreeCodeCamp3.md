## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__
Relatively friendly, the first timers only label lets beginner contributors contribute easily. The contributing instructions are also great, and beause this is a learning platform, the code involving test cases (for people to learn code with) are probably easier to dive into, compared to a more complex app or server.


__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__
Yes, responses are helpful and very quick. 

__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__
Yes, people are generally friendly and professional. 


__Do pull requests get reviewed?__
Yes, they get reviewed very frequently. 

__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__
No, but it makes sense since there are so many contributors, it would probably just crowd the discussion under each issue.

__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__
Basic HTML, JavaScript/TypeScript will allow contributors to find a decent number of issues to contribute to.

__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__
Github account, Gitpod will allow most to do a lot. Some issues require more specific software such as npm and mongoDB.
