## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__ Not that friendly. It seems like the project is only accepting limited types of contributions, and their guides / instructions aren't that extensive either. It's also really hard to find any communication channels, if at all (I couldn't find it).


__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__ Yes, they'll usually try to answer the questions in the issues, although their tone of voice isn't the most overly friendly or nice.

__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__ Couldn't tell, since I couldn't find any communication channels or forums, but in the issues on their github repo, it looks like people are pretty friendly / open to ideas.


__Do pull requests get reviewed?__ Yes



__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__ Yes, they always say something like "Thanks for being part of the Font Awesome Community"



__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__ Not for reporting issues or suggesting ideas, but understanding Javascript could be more helpful in actually fixing code.



__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__ No
