## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__

Not terribly friendly in terms of the infrastructure that they have set up for new contributors seems lacking for sure. The documentation doesn't seem entirely sufficient to start really understanding the stack. However, it definitely seems possible, as there are areas for new contributors to start in.


__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__

Usually they do, either by trying to give a fix or saying that they can't fix it.

__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__

Yes, I haven't seen anything unkind in any of these forums

__Do pull requests get reviewed?__

Yes! The pull requests do get reviewed and usually it doesn't take terribly long after its posted for it to get reviewed.

__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__

Yes, and they go out of their way to recognize non-code contributors in the same way as they recognize code contributors.

__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__

If you know web development, and particularly PHP laravel, you don't need anything else to contribute to the backend really.

__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__

Nope!
