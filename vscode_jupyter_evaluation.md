__Project website:__ [Jupyter Extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter).


__What is the purpose of the project:__ This project aims to create a [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension that provides basic notebook support for [language kernels](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels) that are supported in [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) today, and allows any Python environment to be used as a Jupyter kernel.

## Summary assessment

__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__ There are not many issues that are clearly for beginners, but one can ask questions to get a general idea, which will make things easier. Also, the documentation as to how to contribute is pretty clear, so I do think even beginner contributors will be able to make some contributions to this project.


__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__ Yes. The maintainers give suggestive information as to how to look into the issue, try different versions and environments, etc. One can even ask for a code pointer to where the problem may lie in.


__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__ Yes, they use friendly and welcoming language and provide helpful information.


__Do pull requests get reviewed?__ Yes, mostly within a week.


__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__ Yes, they always do so.



__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__ If there really is any, I would say the ability to read through the documentations. Though the project is built mainly using TypeScript, there are indeed issues that only require Python skills to make a fix, so I think language is not a big problem.



__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__ One would need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 16.14.2, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) 8.15.1, [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.6 or later, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), along with the following extensions in Visual Studio Code:
- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- [EditorConfig for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)
- [Python Extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
