__Project website:__ [The Intergovernmental Software Collaborative ](https://softwarecollaborative.org/)


__What is the purpose of the project: Their website states "we are knitting together collections of intergovernmental agencies based on common needs to help them collaboratively procure, develop, and maintain the software that they all depend on. This will prevent 56 states, territories, and DC from buying 56 versions of near-identical, overpriced software, and instead allows them to procure high-quality, fair-priced software just once, and share it among themselves."

## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors? At first, I thought this project was very open to beginner contributors, but after evaluating this project I saw how difficult it was to communicate with the maintainers as there is no contributing file on their github with instructions on how we can get involved so I question how we can actually participate in this open-source community.




__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues? No



__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)? NA




__Do pull requests get reviewed? yes, but not all



__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions? Yes



__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they? Knowing Ruby



__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they? You have to install Ruby version 2.5.3. and Ruby gem dependencies with bundler, but they provide instructions of how to do that.
