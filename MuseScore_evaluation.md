## Finding info about contributing on the website.

In the following section you should only enter the information that you
found on the project website. Some of the answers will be impossible to find, others
may be very hard to find. Do not _google_ for answers.

__Project website:__ [MuseScore](https://musescore.org/en)


__What is the purpose of the project:__ The purpose of MuseScore is to provide a free and open source music notation software for musicians, producers, and creators of all levels. The software allows users to create, edit, and print sheet music, as well as play back their scores using virtual instrument plugins or external musical instrument digital interface (MIDI) devices.
It provides a user-friendly interface and a wide range of features such as a vast library of music symbols and notation elements and support for various vocal ranges, instruments, and file formats. With the ever-changing musical landscape it is an asset that MuseScore is open source because it enables the software to be regularly updated and improved by the world-wide contributor community to meet the technical needs and creative visions of musicians and beatmakers. 

__How easy was it to find information about contributing on the website?__ 

Very easy to find! There is a navbar on the top with 4 elements, one of them being _Contribute_ . It has 4 subcategories but simply clicking _Contribute_ will provide an [overview](https://musescore.org/en/contribute) and information and links to User support, Documentation of the MuseScore app, Translating, Testing, and Writing plugins. There are 2 main ways users can contribute: the [forum](https://musescore.org/en/forum) and the [source code](https://github.com/musescore/MuseScore) hosted on Github. The forum has many sub-forums including _Support and bug reports_, _Feature requests_, _General discussion_ among others. Users can go here for questions about using the software, reporting bugs, submitting requests of new features, or any general discussion topics. Contributing to development is also fairly simple through this [repository](https://github.com/musescore/MuseScore) with more details in the [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/musescore/MuseScore/wiki)
On the main contributing page on the website, I did not see the required Contributor License Agreement (CLA) that all contributors of non-trivial amounts of code must sign, terms and conditions [here](https://musescore.org/en/cla). I only came across it on the [Contributing tab ](https://github.com/musescore/MuseScore/wiki/Contributing) on the GitHub wiki later.

## Summary assessment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__

I think this project is friendly for beginner contributors especially with the very detailed Contributing page and GitHub Wiki. The forum also seems very helpful and active. 


__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__

Yes. They respond fairly quickly and ask follow-up questions if needed and keep the person who posted the question or issue in the loop. 


__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__

Yes. I joined the Discord server and most of the interactions seem friendly and constructive. There are some users whose communication in the chat comes across as a bit arrogant to me personally, but I think that tone can be difficult to interpret via online chat. I screenshotted the most recent interaction which I thought was not very friendly. (jeetee)’s response seemed somewhat arrogant and demeaning. 

__Do pull requests get reviewed?__

Yes they do seem to get reviewed by someone. 

__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__

Not sure. 

__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__

Since the primary programming language is C++, some familiarity with that may be helpful. 

__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__

I don’t believe so. The MuseScore app can be downloaded for free on all operating systems it seems. [reference](https://musescore.org/en/download)
