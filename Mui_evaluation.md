## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__
It is not beginner friendly because there are so many beginners focusing on contributing to this project. U may have to stare at the issues page all day to be
the first to get assigned. The other problem is that it is such a mature project that doesn't seem needing more contributors.



__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__
Yes, but they are more focused on efficency than being polite and helpful.


__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__
Yes



__Do pull requests get reviewed?__
Yes, and they got the most complicated pr bot I have ever seen.


__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__
Yes, it appeared in most PRs.


__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__
Understanding of Javascript
