## Finding info about contributing on the website.

__Project website:__ [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/)


__What is the purpose of the project:__ The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models. It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage. Rather than rely on hardware to deliver high-availability, the library itself is designed to detect and handle failures at the application layer, so delivering a highly-available service on top of a cluster of computers, each of which may be prone to failures.

## Summary assessment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__

They have a very detailed contributing guide, but I don’t think people with relatively few software development experiences can feel comfortable navigating through them. 



__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__

We can’t see. The communications are mostly in the mailing lists. Still, Hadoop is a very very active project. 


__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__

It’s hard to determine this because most of the issues we see are worked on by one person and we haven’t joined the mailing lists which we presume have more communication.  

__Do pull requests get reviewed?__

It should be. I still don’t exactly understand the workflow. Maybe they do most reviews on the mailing list? 
Some issues have reviewers like this one: https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/5397

__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__

We can’t see the communications. 

__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__

Distributed systems. I feel that the project is also fairly low-level, so contributors needs to be really interested in the project. 

__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__

We didn’t understand it perfectly. The documentation is here: How to Contribute to Apache Hadoop
