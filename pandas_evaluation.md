## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__ I think this project is on a medium level for beginners. There is a lot of helpful documentation for setting up/contributing and issues/discussions are well maintained. However, this is a very big code repository and a very large/longstanding project. Thus, it may be intimidating to get involved but there are issues labelled "good for first issue" which could help a beginner contributor decide where to start.




__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__ yes



__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__ people are pretty friendly




__Do pull requests get reviewed?__ yes



__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__ generally no



__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__ For the most part you just need to know Python and the general flow of developing/test/git



__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__
 C compiler, pip, mamba, pyenv, docker, gitpod
