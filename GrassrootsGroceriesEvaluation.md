## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__
This project does not require much technical knowledge besides TypeScript. I picked this project because I found them at a service fair and thought
it was interesting. Maintainers are fast to respond, even though the team is small. There are also beginner friendly contributor tags, so I would say this project is friendly.

__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__
Yes, responses are helpful and very quick. A little hard to judge right now, since there hasn't been that much discussion so far.

__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__
Yes, people are generally friendly. 

__Do pull requests get reviewed?__
Yes, they get reviewed very frequently. 

__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__
No, but I think "looks good to me" is probably how maintainers thank their contributors for most projects. If we consider that, then yes.

__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__
TypeScript in general. For some of their more specific issues (since the project is moving from a no-code environment to TypeScript), will need knowledge of AirTable (database), Tailwind (css), Twilio (chatbot API).


__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__
Github and npm.
