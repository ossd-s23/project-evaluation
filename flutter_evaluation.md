## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__
I think this project is considerably friendly to beginners. They have very clear contributing instructions, more starter bugs than I've seen on other projects, and a huge, active contributor community.


__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__
Looking at a few of the questions on the beginner issues, the core maintainers seem to be generally nice and responsive, although I did see one user respond a bit rudely to some questions. 


__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__
Yes, they seem to be respectful but definitely a place where many experience developers are discussing what seem to be important changes. One helpful note is that heir Discord has many subcommunities that makes it easier to find people similar in experience or identity.


__Do pull requests get reviewed?__
Yes, the pull requests are reviewed by the core maintainers.


__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__
Yes, on the contributions submitted by users, I see core maintainers saying thanks and showing positive encouragement when reviewing code.


__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__
A deep understanding of web development languages like Dart (very similar to Javascript) if working on the Flutter Framework, and knowledge on C++, Java, and Objective-C if working on the Flutter engine.


__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__
While there are no special hardware requirements, they do require lots of software, such as Chromium's depot_tools, Xcode, and Java JDK.
