## Summary assessment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__
It doesn't seem to be that friendly considering the lack of starter bugs and the complexity of the codebase.



__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__
Due to the large number, it seems like a lot of issues don't get responsese for a while unless they are a top priority fix. Most responses are from bots that enforce certain rules and run tests, but the human responses are generally very helpful.


__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__



__Do pull requests get reviewed?__
Yes, the core team reviews pull requests and either merges, request changes, or closes with and explanation.


__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__



__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__
A deep understanding of Javascript as well as React's functionality are definitely necessary. A good understanding of web browsers' architecture/functionality would be helpful as well.


__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__
They require that you have Yarn, Node, JDK, gcc or another compiler, and git installed.
