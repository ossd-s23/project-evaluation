## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__

The project seems still under development, and for every small project they have on their github, they are open to contributions, so I would say they are open to beginner contributors.


__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues? Seems like it is the same people contributing to the project, but based on their github, they resolve issues quickly. Since the last contribution was last year, I am not sure it still applies



__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)? There is not an open discussion forum, communication seems to be directly from contributors and maintainers since these projects are very small and still under development




__Do pull requests get reviewed? yes



__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions? yes



__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they? No, they are open to beginners and provide resources for users to learn



__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they? Access to git/github. Their open-source projects do not require additional installation
