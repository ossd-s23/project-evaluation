## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__ This project looks a little difficult for a beginner to get involved in. I believe this project is open to contributions of all kinds, but there is not a lot of help for a beginner besides instructions on how to install and some baseline information. It would definitely be hard to know where to start - plus you would need to have underlying knowledge of QGIS



__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__ They respond helpfully, but they are not very fast and they do not get involved in all issues it seems.



__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__ yes generally friendly




__Do pull requests get reviewed?__ yes



__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__ sometimes



__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__ yes QGIS, plugins



__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__ dataset/metadata handling, LaTeX, QT Linguist, GEE
