## Summary assessment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__

This project is convenient for newcomers to contribute, while I am not sure whether it is good for beginners because the issues in the project isn’t in the field I am familiar with. Meanwhile, everyone can report bugs.



__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__

The maintainers aren’t helpful in general. Sometimes regarding bugs users report, maintainers don’t want to take the responsibility. They claim either it is how things should be or it is the problem of third party’s software. Facing a question by a beginner, a maintainer said “Not really, if we knew how to solve the issue we would just go ahead and do so.”


__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__

The maintainers aren’t friendly and supportive. They aren’t very supportive to contributors, and sometimes they give me the feeling that contributors are free labor source who can solve issues they aren’t able to solve.



__Do pull requests get reviewed?__

Yes, most of them get reviewed.


__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__

Usually they don’t.


__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__

Knowledge of Python are required since the project is mostly in Python, while anyone can report bugs and provide suggestions. 


__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__

I’m not sure whether we need special requirements to be able to contribute to the project because they didn’t mention it. Meanwhile, to install Sugar software, we need to install several environments, including Debian or Ubuntu, and Fedora.
