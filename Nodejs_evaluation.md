## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__

The community is very friendly, in the sense that there are a lot of communication channels and extensive documentation regarding how to contribute and where to find resources. However, the issues themselves can be quite complicated, unless you’re looking only at the good-first-issue labeled issues or documentation fixes.


__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__
Yes, although most issues lack discussion. When there are questions, they respond helpfully.


__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__
Most contributors are friendly in the discussions. However, they aren’t overly friendly or nice, but more direct in answering questions or concerns.



__Do pull requests get reviewed?__
Yes, all pull requests need to be reviewed and marked approved once the review is done.


__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__
No, but it might be because of the huge amount of contributions they have to consider rather than unfriendliness. 


__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__
Not in general, as there are documentation and typo fixing issues. However, familiarity with Python or C language is recommended.


__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__
No, as long as you have the JavaScipt / C++ / Python language available on your computer for testing / fixing code issues. If you want to contribute through documentation fixes, then no special hardware / software is required.
