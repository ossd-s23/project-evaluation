## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__
No, as there is a steep learning curve to learn how to even use OpenCV, let alone begint to contribute to it. 



__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__
Yes, issues get resloved fairly quickly and there is often much discussion


__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__
Yes, they have set up a very friendly environment for discussion 



__Do pull requests get reviewed?__
Yes


__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__
Not that I see.


__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__
Contributors must have an understanding of computer vision fundamentals as well as C++/Python.


__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__
No, someone in the discussions mentioned "OpenCV will run on anything. Even on a Raspberry Pi", which is very suprising to me.
