## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__ Pretty friendly, there's a lot of resources and readings to do for beginners so that they are prepared. There's also many friendly people that will help you out in understanding a certain bug and the code.




__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__ Yes, see above :)



__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__ The slack is invite-only, so I can't view how the discussion is like in there.




__Do pull requests get reviewed?__ It looks like most of them do, but it may not be as fast as some other projects, it looks like review happens after about a week of the pull request being created.



__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__ Yes, I saw some maintainers saying thank you.



__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__ Not really, just the programming languages listed above.



__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__ Docker, more info can be found [here](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/tree/master/docker) on installing it.
