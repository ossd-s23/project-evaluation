__Project Name:__ Humanitarian Data Exchange


---

## Finding info about contributing on the website.

In the following section you should only enter the information that you
found on the project website. Some of the answers will be impossible to find, others
may be very hard to find. Do not _google_ for answers.

__Project website:__ [Website](https://data.humdata.org/)


__What is the purpose of the project:__  The Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) is
an open platform for sharing data across crises and organisations. Launched in
July 2014, the goal of HDX is to make humanitarian data easy to find and use for
analysis. Our growing collection of datasets has been accessed by users in over
250 countries and territories.

HDX is managed by OCHA's Centre for Humanitarian Data, which is located in The
Hague, the Netherlands. OCHA is part of the United Nations Secretariat and is
responsible for bringing together humanitarian actors to ensure a coherent
response to emergencies. The HDX team includes OCHA staff and a number of
consultants, based in North America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. 

__How easy was it to find information about contributing on the website?__ There
is a link labeled "Open Source" which is easy to find at the bottom of the
project.

__Contributing instructions:__ While there is information on [how to contribute
data](https://data.humdata.org/faq), there do not seem to be contribution
instructions for repositories.

__URL for the code repository:__ All repositories are stored in one [Github
organization](https://github.com/OCHA-DAP)

__Bug/Issue tracker link:__ Each repository has its own issues tab

__Mailing list:__ Can be subscribed to on the front page near the bottom

__Chat channel:__ A chat channel could not be found

__Other communication channels:__ You can contact the "HDX team" by email, but
other than that there don't appear to be any communication channels other than
through Github issues and the like.

__Are these instructions clear? Do you think they would be easy to follow?__ No,

and learn how to install dependencies and use the setup.cfg to install the
project (not difficult, but there are no instructions)
