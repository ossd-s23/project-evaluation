## Summary assesment

**How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?**

I would say pretty friendly for contributors. We definitely need to spend time
understanding the architecture first, but it shouldn't need too much specialized
knowledge.

**Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?**

The maintainers respond fairly quickly to issues and triage them appropriately.
They provide a lot of information there.

**Do pull requests get reviewed?**

Yes, it seems that the reviewer is really helpful and share their detailed
thoughts.

**Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?**

Yes.

**Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what
are they?**

I don't believe there is a lot. Willingness to learn new programming languages
and architecture is probably preferred.

**Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute
to the project? If so, what are they?**

A Macbook is preferred, since this project works on macbooks.
