## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__
Not terribly friendly. It requires a great deal of domain specific knowledge as well as a willingness to dive into a complicated codebase with relatively esoteric code submission mechanisms. However, there are ample resources and there is a desire for and capacity to take on new contributors.



__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__
Yes


__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__
Yes in general, but new contributors should go to the linked linux newbies forum to ask relatively simple questions, those that would sometimes be called "stupid" questions



__Do pull requests get reviewed?__
Yes patchlists do absolutely get reviewed


__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__
Yes


__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__
A deep knowledge of modern operating systems, a willingness to specialize, and background in the overall structure of the kernel.


__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__
Running a virtual machine to test is necessary to test most things. Otherwise no, besides the fact that you need a lot of storage to hold the whole kernel source and time to compile it
