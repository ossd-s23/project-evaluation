- __are there issues marked "good for newbies", "beginner" or some other indicators that imply that they are good for beginner contributors:__ yes

    - __how many of such issues are there?__ 31 issues
    
    - __look at a few of them, do they look beginner friendly?__ 
They seem fairly complicated at first glance, but a lot of them have helpful comments and questions, and I'm sure with a bit more time people in our class could comfortable make the fixes.


- __are there issues marked "documentation" or some other indicators that imply that they are documentation (user or developer specific):__ yes

    - __how many of such issues are there?__ 11
    
    - __look at a few of them, do you think you could submit a fix?__ 
    I don't think it would be good for newcomers to contribute to these just because they mostly have to do with onboarding docs, which should be maintained by people with more experience.

## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__
There are parts of this project that make it very beginner friendly, namely the amount of resources and the presence of curated starter bugs with lots of people willing to help. However, there is almost too much documentation regarding how to use and contribute to the project, which could lead to some trouble with getting involved. Their custom issue tracker might also take some getting used to.


__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__
Yes, from looking at the starter issues, there are a few people who consistently answer questions and check in on the people who claimed them.


__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__
I did not see any cases of rudeness or disrespect in the issue comments, and while I could not access the IRC Chat for some reason, I assume that they are the same. They have a set of [OpenMRS Chat Tips](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/IRC/OpenMRS+Chat+Tips), which is like a mini code of conduct for their communication channels, which further leads me to believe that they are serious about being friendly and respectful.


__Do pull requests get reviewed?__
Yes, all of the pull requests get reviewed by the core maintainers.


__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__
I didn't see much in terms of specific messages expressing thanks in pull requests, but they seem to appreciate any and all contributions, even if a new user is not exactly sure how to proceed.


__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__
Contributors should definitely have good Java skills and know how to use an API to modify Java objects. They have a very detailed technical overview going over every detail of the architecture, but it sounds like understanding this is not necessary to contribute.

__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__
They require a lot of software, mostly frameworks and build tools for Java, including Maven and Spring. They also require Docker, their custom SDK, and an instance of their server.
